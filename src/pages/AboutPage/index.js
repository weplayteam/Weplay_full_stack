                    <p>It all began while refereeing at a local indoor soccer facility to make enough money to pay for school. Late hours turned into learning sessions. I began to think about how could I improve the business for the better. In the background, hearing players complaining about league information they didn’t have, players not aware of game times, owners not receiving payments on time, etc. WePlay is a social network search engine service, namely, providing an online social network in the field of sports recreation and providing management tools to facilitate things, such as; payment, marketing, and communication.
