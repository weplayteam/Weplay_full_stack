                    <p>It all began while refereeing at a local indoor soccer facility to make enough money to pay for school. Late hours turned into learning sessions. I began to think about how could I improve the business for the better. In the background, hearing players complaining about league information they didnâ€™t have, players not aware of game times, owners not receiving payments on time, etc. WePlay is a social network search engine service, namely, providing an online social network in the field of sports recreation and providing management tools to facilitate things, such as; payment, marketing, and communication.
